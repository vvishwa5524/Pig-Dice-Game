# 🎲 Pig Dice Game

The **Pig Dice Game** is a fun and interactive two-player web game developed during my JavaScript course. This project combines simplicity, strategy, and luck, and serves as a memorable part of my learning journey in web development.

## 🕹️ Game Rules
1. **Two Players**: The game is played between two players.
2. **Objective**: Be the first to score **100 points**.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling a dice.
   - The dice value is added to the player's current score unless they roll a `1`.
   - Rolling a `1` resets the player's current score, and their turn ends.
   - Players can choose to "Hold" to save their current score, adding it to their total.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins!
